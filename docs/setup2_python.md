# Task 2: Installing Python on your Computer

In this class, we will be teaching you Python programming from the ground up! The best way to learn Python is by practicing as often as you can. By installing python directly on your laptop, you can practice anywhere and anytime you like, with or without an internet connection.   

## Downloading and building Python from source

Python might already be installed natively on your laptop (if you are a mac user) or can be installed using many applications (e.g. Anaconda, a package for data science and Bioinformatics). These applications may have different versions of Python. To simplify installation and make trouble shooting in the class easy, we will all be using the same version of Python and installing it from source on your laptop. The most recent stable version of Python is 3.11 from December 6, 2022. To get started, download the appropriate installer for your laptop (Mac or PC) from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3111/). Then, follow the steps for the installation to your laptop.
